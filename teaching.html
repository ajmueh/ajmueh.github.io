										<p>Below are some of the courses, with brief discriptions, I've helped conduct as a teaching fellow at Yale. </p>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="6u 12u$(small)">
												<h3>Introduction to R</h3>
												<p>We teach students how to think analytically/statistically and process and analyze their data in the programming language R. Begins with R fundamentals, data import, manipulation, and subsetting, and ends with advanced statistics and illustrations. Taught for three semesters.</p>
											</div>

											<div class="6u$ 12u$(small)">
												<h3>Ecology & Conservation of Tropical Forests</h3>
												<p>This course covers the fundamental ecology of tropical forests, mechanisms generating biodiversity, and the challenges regarding their conservation. We ask and answer such questions as, why are tropical forests so diverse? What is their relationship to the biosphere? What is the human dimension in terms of their use, preservation, and ecology? Taught for one semester.</p>
											</div>

											<div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
												<h3>Tropical Field Ecology</h3>
												<p>A joint course with F&ES masters students and E&EB undergraduates, where we studied abroad in Ecuador for two weeks, travelling to multiple ecosystems from the Andes to the Amazon and learning their ecology first-hand. We got to cover much of the same transect that Alexander von Humboldt wrote about in his expedition to the Americas. Taught for one semester.</p>
											</div>
											<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
												<h3>Trees: Environmental Biology & Global Significance</h3>
												<p>We teach students about the physiology and function of trees/forests. Involves both the evolutionary history and key functional adaptations that make trees what they are, as well as role forests play in the biosphere. Taught for one semester.</p>
