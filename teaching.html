										<h3>Teaching Philosophy</h3>
											<p>I believe that the most important concept a student can internalize is that of "self-efficacy", or the belief in one's ability to overcome challenges, learn new things, and create something from nothing. This concept is particularly important in a field such as Data Science, where methods are always evolving, can be complex, and are diverse and idiosyncratic to specific subfields. I consider it key then that students develop not just a comprehensive toolkit of core skills, but the capacity and willingness to learn new skills on their own. For this reason, there are three practices that structure my approach to teaching: 
												<ol>
													<li><b>Assignment design that leads instead of pushes</b></li>
														<p>When teaching data and scientific literacy, the primary goal should be to achieve higher-order learning objectives <i>i.e.</i> to transition from reiteration/memorization to synthesis/creation. Assignment design that initially demands little of students, but progressively encourages them to apply what they've learned in increasingly unstructured ways is a powerful way to achieve such outcomes.
														</p>
													<li><b>Instructor modeling of authentic practice</b></li>
														<p>While many students will learn to succeed in the classroom, they rarely have the opportunity to practice their skills in a more realistic setting. I try to model workflows authentic to science and industry in the classroom, demonstrate practical skills for overcoming regular challenges they can expect to encounter, and provide students a broader context for what they're learning.</p>
													<li><b>Facilitation of positive psychology</b></li>
														<p>Self-efficacy is an important component of success in Data Science, but who has an intrinsic sense of self-efficacy and who needs time to develop that sense is unevenly distributed. Many students from a variety of backgrounds must overcome anxieties and negative perceptions of themselves before they can flourish. To mitigate this disparity, I use active engagement in the classroom, proactive interaction with students, acknowledgement of the often challenging nature of the material, and consistent reminder that the material is tractable.
